# A node-express-passport-hbs boilerplate
Just a simple starting point for apps that require passport auth. Uses:
- express
- passport
- hbs templates
- mongodb via mongoose

## Done
- Basic installation of various libs

## Todo
- Full local (email) auth strategy and related utils, including:
-- Login
-- Registration
-- Password reset
-- Change password
-- Change email
- Mailer lib setup
- Decision on including css framework (might leave this out of the boilerplate)
- Decision on including client-side frameworks beyond handlebars
